Hi, I'm Zhihao Lou. I'm a Senior Director of Optimization in Decision Sciences at [Epsilon](https://epsilon.com). My day job involves designing distributed algorithm for [Real-Time Bidding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding) in programatic advertising buying. 

I have a PhD in computer science from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I developed a scalable paralel simulated annealing algorithm so it can work on modern supercomputers[^1]. I also contributed the simulated annealing algorithm optimizer in the great [Ensmallen](https://ensmallen.org/) library[^2].

This is my blog where I write about a variety of things I'm currently learning. Hope you'll find some bits or pieces that's useful.
