Hi, I'm Zhihao Lou. I'm a PhD student in computer science in the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu). My main research project involves parallelizing simulated annealing algorithm so it can work on modern supercomputers like [Beagle2](http://beagle.ci.uchicago.edu). You can find my resume [here](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~zhlou).

This is my blog where I write about a variety of things I'm currently learning. Hope you'll find some bits or pieces that's useful.
